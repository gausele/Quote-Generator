# Quote-Generator
A simple program I made which randomly generates a quote.
Open quote.exe and click on generate quote to randomly generate a quote. If you want to change, add or delete any quotes, you can do it through modifying quotes.txt. Remember that each line is a new quote, and a line break seperates two quotes.
